## PylonModeler: A hybrid-driven 3D reconstruction method for power transmission pylons from LiDAR point clouds
PylonModeler is a hybrid-driven 3D reconstruction method for power transmission pylons based on ALS point clouds by integrating data-driven and model-driven algorithms, enabling the accurate, robust, and real-time efficient pylon. reconstruction. 

The key features in Pylon-Modeler are:
> * The PylonModeler realizes the accurate reconstruction of the pylon in real time. The topology structure and semantic information of the constructed 3D model have been well balanced, which greatly improves the usability of the model.
> * We propose a lite and flexible Transformer network, Pylon Former, for real-time power pylon recognition and pylon head positioning from UAV-borne LiDAR data. The method achieves the accurate identification and the decomposition of the pylon for facilitating the pylon reconstruction. In addition, this approach reduces the dependence of reconstruction methods on data quality.
> * A concise and efficient parameter optimization algorithm is specially designed to reconstruct the pylon head model. The method utilizes coherent point drift (CPD) algorithm to establish the topological relationships among pylon head structures and determine the initial value of model parameters. The method reduces the parameter search space, which improves the efficiency and stability of the parameter optimization.
